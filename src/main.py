# --- 1. Realistic: Late-night study session --------------------------------
# Wants slow, organic, mildly positive lofi.  Strong acoustic preference.

    "target_acousticness": 0.78,
}

# --- 2. Realistic: Pre-workout pump-up -------------------------------------
# High energy, fast tempo, very danceable pop.  Acoustic sound is unwanted.
HIGH_ENERGY_POP = {
    "name":                "High-Energy Pop Fan",
    "favorite_genre":      "pop",
    "favorite_mood":       "intense",
    "target_energy":       0.92,

    "target_danceability": 0.90,

}

# --- 3. Realistic: Late-night brooding rock --------------------------------
# Wants loud, fast, dark-feeling rock.  Low valence (moody/angry tone).
DEEP_ROCK = {
    "name":                "Deep Intense Rock",

    "target_danceability": 0.60,
    "target_acousticness": 0.10,
}

# --- 4. Adversarial: Contradictory energy vs mood -------------------------
# "I want moody/sad vibes (low valence) but at extremely high energy."
# Real examples: angry metal, intense workout music with dark lyrics.
# Expected behavior: high-energy songs win even though their mood won't match.
# Potential surprise: "Gym Hero" (pop/intense, energy=0.93) could rank high
# despite having happy valence — the energy and tempo match overpowers the
# valence mismatch.
CONFLICTING_ENERGY_MOOD = {

    "target_tempo":        160,
    "target_danceability": 0.55,
    "target_acousticness": 0.05,
}

# --- 5. Adversarial: Genre that doesn't exist in the catalog --------------
# "classical/peaceful" is in the catalog, but "opera" is not.
# Expected behavior: genre bonus never fires (+0.0 for every song), so the
# system falls back entirely on numeric features.  The quietest, slowest,
# most acoustic songs will win regardless of their genre label.
MISSING_GENRE = {
    "name":                "Opera Fan (genre not in catalog)",

    "target_danceability": 0.30,
    "target_acousticness": 0.95,
}

# --- 6. Adversarial: All targets at dead-center 0.5 ----------------------
# Every numeric target is the midpoint of the 0–1 scale.
# Expected behavior: every song gets nearly identical numeric scores;
# the only differentiator becomes genre/mood match.  Exposes whether
# categorical bonuses alone are enough to produce a meaningful ranking,
# or whether everything collapses to near-ties.
